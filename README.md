# Hand-in Hand

**Hand-in Hand** is a platform designed to connect restaurants, grocery stores, and individuals with surplus food to local charities, food banks, and people in need. By redistributing excess food, we aim to reduce food waste and fight hunger in communities. The platform provides a seamless way for people and organizations to donate food to those who need it most.

## Features

- **Food Donation**: Connect surplus food providers (restaurants, grocery stores, individuals) with local charities, food banks, and people in need.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Send alerts to charities and recipients when food donations are available nearby.
- **Easy Interface**: A user-friendly platform for both donors and recipients to easily manage and track donations.
